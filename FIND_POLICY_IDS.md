## From Your Policy List

### Payment Policies (Need to click to see ID):
- **"Managed Payments"** → Click this policy to see the full ID
- **"Payments managed by eBay"** → Click this policy to see the full ID

**How to find:** 
1. Click on the policy name in eBay Seller Hub
2. Look at the URL - the ID is usually in the URL
3. Or check the policy details page

### Shipping/Fulfillment Policies (Need to click to see ID):
These are your **Fulfillment Policies** (Shipping policies):

2. The Policy ID appears in:
   - The browser URL (look for a long alphanumeric string)

   - Sometimes shown as "Policy ID: xxxxxx"

## Quick Steps:

1. Go to eBay Seller Hub → **Account → Business Policies**
2. Click on the policy name you want to use
3. Look at the URL - it will look like:
   ```
   https://www.ebay.com/sh/account/policies/fulfillment/4b040f2c108e000
   ```
   The ID is the part after the last `/`
4. Copy that ID and paste it into the Manual Entry form

## Recommended Policies from Your List:

**For Return Policy:** Use `4b040f2c108e000` (No Return Accepted) or `257398528019` (30 days money back)

**For Payment Policy:** Click "Managed Payments" to get the ID

**For Fulfillment/Shipping Policy:** Click one of your shipping policies (like "International Shipping No Exclusions") to get the ID

## Merchant Location Key:

This is different - it's your shipping location. You can:
1. Leave it blank for now (optional)
2. Or go to **Account → Shipping Preferences** to find it
3. Or it might be set automatically when you create listings
